#### ðŸ’¡ SEMANTIC VERSIONING

SemVer is a popular versioning scheme that is used by a vast amount of open-source projects to communicate the changes included in a version release.

<h3>SemVer Versioning</h3>

Under the SemVer versioning scheme, our versioning would take on the following format:

```sh
  X.Y.Z
```

Where x, y, and z are integers that increase numerically and indicate Major, Minor, and Patch, respectively.
